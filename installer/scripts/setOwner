# This script applies an owner ref to the resources that match the provided selector.
# The owner ref is the Application specified by NAMESPACE and APP_NAME
# Any resources (apart from Pods) which match the --selector=$TARGET_SELECTOR are updated
#
# IMPORTANT: This is required in order for resources to be cleaned up correctly when the application is
# uninstalled. If that does not happen, the `mpdev verify` command will fail.
# Usually the deployer would automatically set owner references on the resources it creates, as it assumes those are
# the ones that make up the application. In our case though, we create a `Job` that in turn creates the actual
# Gloo resources; so we need this additional step to then set the owner references on them.
