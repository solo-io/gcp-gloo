  # unlike our common helm charts, we pass the image in full
  # this is because the marketplace helper splitToRegistryRepoTag produces:
  #  {registry: solo-io-public, repository: gloo/installer, tag: 1.2}
  #  and the "gcr.io" prefix is ignored (I expected it in the registry string)
  #  which means that we either need to restrict alternative images to gcr.io hosts or implement
  #  an elaborate template function to allow other hosts
  image:
    # set by marketplace
    # full: gcr.io/solo-io-public/gloo/installer:1.2
